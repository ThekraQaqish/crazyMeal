### How many hours did it take you to complete this assignment?

It took me approximately **20 hours** to complete the project.  
- **16 hours** were spent on styling, including choosing a color palette, fonts, and layout.  
- **4 hours** were spent on implementing functionality using JavaScript.

### Were there any parts of the lab you found challenging?

Yes, I faced challenges when working with **GitHub and branches**.  
There was an issue when I tried to create a pull request between the `main` and `crazy-meal-dev` branches, as they had **entirely different commit histories**.  
Additionally, I had to troubleshoot issues with remote repository setup, and I learned how to reset and re-link my local project to GitHub properly.
